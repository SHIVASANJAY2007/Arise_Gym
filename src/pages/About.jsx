                <h2>More Than a Gym – A Revolution</h2>
                
                <p>At ARISE, we don't just change bodies—we transform lives. Founded in 2023, our gym was born from a simple idea: fitness should empower, not intimidate. Named after the relentless spirit of rising above limits, ARISE is where beginners become athletes, and athletes become legends.</p>

                <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
                <p>We reject the "no pain, no gain" cliché. Instead, we follow "Smart Pain, Maximum Gain"—a science-backed approach blending strength training, mobility work, and recovery protocols. Our programs are designed by ISSA-certified coaches who prioritize form, functionality, and sustainable results over quick fixes.</p>

                <h2>The ARISE Difference</h2>
                <ul>

                <h2>Meet the Founders</h2>

                    <p>– Usain bolt & Riley, ex-professional athletes turned fitness architects</p>
